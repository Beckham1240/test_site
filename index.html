            <h1>Career Overview</h1> 
            <p> 
                I have only been employed once so far in my life, which was at Kumon. I worked as  
                a grader there for both subjects, Math and English. Working at Kumon was decent as the  
                work was simple, but was tiring work as it was a fast-paced job and a job where you would  
                have to sometimes multitask things for 4 hours.

            <h1>Employment, Work, & Volunteer History</h1> 
            <p> 
                I am currently in NHS, which is basically a club pertaining to volunteer work, where I volunteer  
                for various things. Things like helping out at events hosted by other clubs in my school, events hosted  
                by other schools (middle schools and high schools), and events hosted by business owners or anyone in the  
                community. I am also currently employed at KUMON, which is an after school learning center where kids can  
                go and learn extra math or english. My job at KUMON is the first and only job I currently have.
